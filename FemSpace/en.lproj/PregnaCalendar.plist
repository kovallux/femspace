		<string>Day 267 – 273. Theoretically, this is the last week of your pregnancy. Some women become happy moms by this time, while some need to wait a little. If you still bear the child, you have noted for sure that it has stopped its activity. It is fully ready to be born: the cranial bones are formed in a way to allow the head to pass easily through the birth channels.</string>

		<string>You are surely tired of being pregnant. But don’t rush the events: everything should happen in its time. Try distracting yourself with usual chores or things that you like to do. Of course, this should not be extreme riding, but reading favorite books, watching old movies or looking through family albums will distract you very well for a while.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>Your body is completely ready for childbirth. The vesical cervix became softer, “ripened” and on any day you may notice a slimy ball of vaginal excretions. This is called the “cork” which seals the vesical cervix and protects the child from external influence. In the case the cork has come out, the waters may start bursting!</string>

		<string>Days 260 – 266. Good news: now your pregnancy achieved its full term. The child is fully formed and… may appear any time! The babies born between the 38th and 40th weeks are healthy and this period is believed to be the best for delivery. The child’s fatty layer allows it to regulate its body temperature to feel warm and comfortable in the outer world.</string>

		<string>As a rule the pregnant woman stops gaining weight in the last weeks of pregnancy. It is hard for you to walk, and your back aches. Unfortunately, not a single future mom is protected from that. You may ask your husband or some relative to massage lightly your legs and back, but this should be done very carefully.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>This week you will need to see your doctor again. He will run you through a complete check to establish your readiness for delivery. They will measure your blood pressure, test the 	uterine tonus, measure the circumference of your belly and do additional tests if needed.</string>

		<string>Days 253 – 259. Congratulations! By the end of this week your pregnancy will have achieved its full term. Make sure that the bag with stuff you need for the maternity ward is all packed. Double-check – do you have everything that the child will need in the first days of its life? Even now the child continues growing and putting on weight. Some children may weigh up to 3 kg, and their height varies around 50 cm. In the case this is your first pregnancy you may feel the first indications of delivery. For example, your tummy will get lower, and you may start feeling discomfort in your lower abdomen. Frequent visits to the toilet are another normal reaction of the body. The activity of the child in this period is close to nothing: it is so big that it does not have any room to let you know about it.</string>

		<string>Now, when just a small while is left, all things are packed and you are psychologically ready for delivery, you may rest and enjoy the last weeks of pregnancy. The father of the child also needs to be ready: he should fill the gas tank of your car to take you to the maternity ward quickly, and he should also massage your feet. If you continue working – rest as much as possible. Look in the distance, allow yourself to relax for a couple of minutes. Also in case you go to work by public transport – avoid rush hours. Ask your boss to adjust your schedule to allow you to come to the office with comfort.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>If you see that your partner gets nervous more than usually – try to calm him down. This is normal, as he is also getting ready for a new family member. Emotions sometimes overwhelm the future parents and they become unstable. You need to talk to each other as much as possible, support and calm each other down. Everybody has to live through this, and you need to find comfort in the thoughts about your future child.</string>

		<string>Days 246 – 252. Your child continues putting on weight and occupies most space in your womb. Its height may amount to 48 cm, and its weight – to – 2.7 kg. Children born on the 36th week of pregnancy are quite healthy. Of course, they are small and fragile, but this is curable – the nurses will do everything to nurture the baby to health.</string>

		<string>It is time to prepare your perineum for childbirth. For your vaginal tissue to become more elastic and stretch easily during delivery without any tears and bleeding, you need to do the following. Oil and delicately massage this area with Vitamin E oil, you can also use oil for children or even any vegetable oil. Some of the pregnant may also have small urine leaks. This happens because of stress and the woman does not always feel that a small accident has occurred. In the case you go to work or public areas – ear a night hygienic pad which will protect you from embarrassment.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>Not only the child grows inside you – your uterus also does. Before pregnancy it weighed about 40 grams, now – around 800 grams! You may feel that your tummy began hanging low. This is the way it should be – the child positioned itself with the head down, and is getting ready for birth. Just a little time left!</string>

		<string>Days 239 – 245. The child is very comfy inside you, but it has so little space left that it seldom “communicates” with you and almost never moves. The prenatal hairs have disappeared from the child’s body and its fatty layer became strong enough to warm it up when it is born into this world. The weight of the child is 2.5 kg, and its height is about 46 cm.</string>

		<string>Pay attention to your blood pressure: you should rest more in case it is high. At this stage the doctors may diagnose all the specifics of your baby, and in case you need a Caesarian they will let you know now. In case you didn’t take maternity leave yet – maybe it is time to think about it? However, it is up to you to decide, and in case you still have strength to work – the decision is yours.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>Have you decided yet whether you will deliver the child alone or together with your partner? If you opted for the latter talk to your partner (the father of the child, your mother, sister, friend), discuss the details and just think about this moment together. Many women have pains in the back during delivery, so we recommend you take several massage courses from a good specialist. This will give you the possibility to prepare your back for the delivery and cheer you up – which is very important for the future mom.</string>

You must have already read a lot of specialized literature and in case you have more questions than answers – ask them to your doctor. In order not to lose shape try walking in open air. You may practice fast walking – this will keep your muscles toned and your breathing system trained.</string>

The child already has its own routine – it goes to sleep and wakes up at one and the same time. However, it still spends most of its time sleeping, and stays awake for much less time. It switches from high brain activity to periods of quick sleep and prolonged deep slow sleep periods. Sweet dreams, baby!</string>

		<string>The Yoga is a great way to develop flexibility and endurance which you will need when you deliver the child. Besides, it calms you down greatly, tunes you to positive emotions and normalizes your emotional status. Many future moms may have a very good appetite. You should not refuse food; however, it will do you no good if you eat too much. You better eat often but in small portions, this way you won’t put on extra kilos and won’t hurt the little one’s health. Do not forget to replenish your iron levels, to do this you should eat iron-rich cereal breakfasts, wholemeal bread, dark green vegetables and dried apricots. You still feel itching? Try calming cream or oil. In the case itching causes too much discomfort – don’t hesitate to ask your doctor about treatment, as in some rare cases this may be a sign of liver diseases.</string>

		<string>In the case you have decided to deliver your baby at home, make all the necessary preparations. What will you need?

		<string>Your large tummy causes more and more discomfort at night? Try sleeping on your side, bending your legs in the knees and holding the pillow with your arms. In case you have cramps in your legs – move your toes energetically. In the case you have pains in your legs or varicose veins – you should wear supporting pantyhose. Ask your doctor about which of them you should wear. Light massage will also help relieve fatigue of your legs. You may also lie down for a while and relax putting a cushion under your feet. Some pregnant women at late pregnancy terms suffer from gum bleeding. This is a usual side effect which occurs quite frequently. This happens because estrogen makes the gums swell and become softer. Visit your dentist, he will suggest some medicine to take care of your mouth.</string>

In case you have twins, do not be surprised if they will remind you of themselves less often. They really don’t have enough space, and because of that they can’t kick with their legs or hit with their arms. In the case you await a boy, his testicles move down from his body into the scrotum during this period.</string>

		<string>In case you still continue working we strongly suggest you take maternity leave or reduce the workload. Late pregnancy terms may bring such effects as pains in the back and the lower back, indigestion and sleeping disorders, as well as emotional «big dippers»! You may also note that you have started putting on weight quickly. This is normal. However, if this troubles you – go see your doctor who will adjust your diet. However, you should not reduce your food intake, and definitely should not go on a diet! In the case you still have sex, you must have noticed that your tummy stands in the way. Try the “spoon” position – no discomfort – just pleasure!</string>

		<string>Most women suffer from insomnia at later pregnancy stages. It is often caused by the fact that the future mom has difficulties in finding a comfortable position to sleep. Besides, many women need to visit the toilet very often, and as a rule this happens in the most unnecessary moment –when you finally start falling asleep. Some may have strange dreams and even nightmares. This may be caused by the fear of the upcoming delivery and emotional strain. Discuss this with your doctor.</string>

		<string>It is quite possible that you will need to see your doctor again. He will measure your blood pressure to help in case you have swells. Besides, in the case you have Rh (-) blood, you will need to take a test for antigens. You might need to take some medicine. In the case you are worried about your pregnancy and moved your personal life to the back of the stage – your partner may feel lonely. Spend some time together: drink some tea and just chat about something. In the case you feel your bra sometimes becomes soaked with your first milk – buy special bra pads: they will absorb all the liquid and you will feel secure even at work. In case you don’t have milk – don’t worry: some moms start having it only after delivery. To support the energy in your body treat yourself to a banana-milk shake.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>It is time to start thinking of the type of delivery you would like to have. Maybe you want to deliver at home, or in water? Who will be present at the delivery – you husband, mom or sister? Weigh all the pros and cons, find out all the nuances and specifics. When you make a decision, let your doctor know.</string>

To get its lungs ready for life in open air, the child breathes in amniotic fluid. If the baby will have hiccups you will feel a murmur in your belly. Very cute!</string>

		<string>You have surely started thinking of the birth of your little one. Try to do everything to get the father as much involved with the pregnancy world as possible. In the case he knows everything about pregnancy and what it means to bear a child – he will be able to provide you with qualified assistance if necessary. And you will have someone to discuss your next change of mood with. Some future moms may get worried with the size of breasts or the form of their nipples. Believe us that the amount of milk does not depend on that, and the babies do not care about the form of your breasts and will readily feed.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>You might need to take a blood test to check your health condition. Some pregnant may have problems with anemia – increased fatigue. In case you feel weak – go see your doctor right away: not only does it harm you, it also does harm the health of the placenta.</string>

Use moisturizing cream – this will calm your skin and help avoid stretches. However, if you already have them, the cream by itself won’t help much. Do you sing to your child? If not – start right away – this will calm you both down. Play some relaxing music to the child.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>The pregnant often develop varicose veins. This is due to the fact that during gestation the walls of the veins become weaker and stretch. To avoid or reduce stretching, try not to stand for a long time. It is better if you move: walk or swim. You should also put a cushion or pillow under your legs when you sleep. This will reduce swelling and will let your legs rest until morning. You may try special supporting pantyhose, which you can get from a drug store. Pay attention that the rubber does not put pressure on your tummy.</string>

You may suffer of leg edema, hypertension and fatigue. In the case you have these symptoms or the nurse sees there is something wrong with your tests – go see your doctor. Sometimes you may have pains in the lower abdomen. This may be a sign of stretching of the uterus muscles. You may also become moody. Some mothers have prenatal depressions. Do not push your fears inside, talk to your husband, friends or a good psychologist.</string>

The pregnant look charming and everybody around will surely try to support you as much as they can. Try wearing loose outfits, and keep your tummy away from tight skirts and belts. Do not lift weights, and in the case you drop something you should bend your knees to pick it up, but don’t bend in the waist!</string>

		<string>Some pregnant may have troubles with such an intimate issue as hemorrhoid (inflation of the veins around your anus). This is a very common complaint as during pregnancy the veins become weaker. This might lead to itching and even small bleeding when visiting the toilet. In the case you become affected by this, don’t hesitate to seek advice from your doctor with regard to which medicine to use. And don’t worry – it will go away after delivery.</string>

		<string>This is a captivating time, as you are likely to go for ultrasonography this week. It is necessary to check the growth of the child and the formation of its spine and internal organs. Enjoy watching the child on the monitor! In the middle of pregnancy you might suddenly experience flushes of heat. This is normal, as blood circulates in your body at a higher speed. Should that happen – be calm and unbutton your shirt or take it off in the case you have a T-shirt underneath. Try wearing clothes from natural fabric. You may start having excretions from you r nipples. This is neogala – your first milk.</string>

		<string>Days 134 – 140. You are in the middle of your pregnancy. Congratulations! The child now weighs around 310 grams and its height is around 26 cm. Its muscles develop quickly; the amniotic fluid space became larger which gives it the possibility to perform its first “acrobatic stunts”. The child’s body produces special white slime: this “hydro insulation” protects its skin when swimming in the amniotic fluid. Some children are born with remnants of this layer over their body. But that does not make them less cute!</string>

		<string>Your tummy grows upwards and forwards, that’s why your navel may “hop out“ a little (that depends on your individual body features). After physical exercise such as walking upstairs your breathing may become hard: this is normal. It happens because the uterus starts pushing on the diaphragm, leaving less space for your lungs. The child is very active now. He did not turn his head downwards (the usual position for birth), that will happen later. Enjoy the energy of your child!</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>Your child may feel the aroma and taste of the food you eat when it swallows amniotic fluid. So try not to restrict your ration in any way, and make your diet more nutritious, healthy and balanced.</string>

Sensor development goes at full speed: the child may feel, determine taste and odor, hear and see. This is all due to the development of the brain.

Besides, it also performs a protective function: it protects the child from potential infections which may get transferred through your blood. It filters all the hazardous substances not letting them to the child. This is a perfect barrier.</string>

		<string>In the case you and your partner haven’t tried communicating with the child yet – this is a good time to start. Lock yourself (the three of you!) in a quiet room so that nobody and nothing would distract you with noise, and then start talking. Let you beloved one kiss your tummy at the end of the “conversation”. This brings the partners closer, and psychologists highly recommend this intimate communication. Your uterus grows intensively and moves upwards. Now it is between your pelvis bone and your navel. It is time to buy clothes for the pregnant in the case you haven’t done some shopping yet. You may still want to visit the toilet often, however you should pay attention to burning sensations on passing water – you might have cystitis and then you need to visit your doctor! In the case you continue having physical exercise – be more careful. Your tendons are now much softer than usual, and any brusque movement may harm you. Avoid smoking companies and remember that passive smoking is harmful for the child.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>You have hot flushes? This is normal. As a result of hormonal changes the metabolism speeds up, and the blood vessels become wider. Try wearing several layers of clothing, so that if necessary you could easily take off the upper jacket. Avoid spicy food, alcohol and caffeine: this may influence your vesicular system and your health.</string>

Thin hairs form all over its body, they are called lanugo. They protect the tender skin of the child and help keep the temperature of its body stable.

Your placenta is fully formed and fully supports the life of the child. It nourishes the child in the uterus and produces hormones which sustain your pregnancy. It is now time to take the first tests to identify Down’s syndrome. The simplest way to do it is to take a blood test. Based on the results the doctor may also schedule amniocentesis, which will reveal chromosome anomalies if any.</string>

However, there is pleasant news: vomiting and morning sickness start fading, and very soon these things will stop troubling you altogether. In the case you still have morning sickness – comfort yourself with the thought that this is not forever. The emotional status of the future mother usually becomes more stable. Her body already got used to it, and the unnecessary worries have left her mind. You already started reading specialized books on childbirth and went to prenatal training courses, didn’t you?</string>

		<string>You might still feel fatigue and experience morning sickness – most future moms stop having these symptoms around the 12th or 13th week. You will need to do an ultrasonography to see if you have twins, and to confirm the pregnancy term. An early ultrasonography will help establish any existing fetal pathologies, as well as to evaluate the general health condition of the future child. By the way, in the case you have twins you are likely to get tired twice as quickly as the other pregnant. Thus, take care of yourself. Eat healthy food. A chocolate bar is intriguing; however, eating an apple will do you much more good.</string>

In case you did not select your gynecologist yet – hurry up. The doctor needs to consult you during the pregnancy and you need to discuss the preparation to childbirth and childbirth itself. He will put down your pregnancy history and will help if necessary.  Continue watching over your health, do not take any alcohol. In the case you allow yourself a glass of wine, you shouldn’t do it more often than once a week. And it is best if you dump alcohol altogether until the end of the lactation period.</string>

		<string>You should protect your child from passive smoking as soon as possible. Thus, not only should you quit smoking, but also avoid the company of smokers. Cigarette smoke reduces the influx of oxygen to the child, and this in turn leads to intensified heartbeat, which might later lead to low weight and sudden child death. Besides, the children of those parents who smoke run a higher risk of bronchitis and pneumonia in their first year of life. Thus we remind you once again: quit smoking, as right now this is the best thing you can do for your child.</string>

Its legs and arms develop actively and start having the shape we are used to. Very soon the fingers will start developing. The face also starts developing: under the layer of skin you can see the nostrils, lips and eyes of the future child. The neural system and the brain of your child develop rapidly. For this reason the embryo’s head is disproportionally big for the rest of the body: this is a sign of the active growth and development of the brain. The internal organs are in their right positions, and the heartbeat of your child is now quickened. The embryo finally becomes a full-fledged fetus.</string>

Or perhaps you start having fears not known to you before: of the future, the child, fright of delivery? This again is caused by the hormones, so just ask your partner to bear with you.

In turn, toxoplasmosis may hurt your future child. Take all the necessary measures and don’t worry for nothing: most women are immune to this infection, especially if the pet lives in the household for a long time.

		<string>Your child is now a group of small blastocysts, attached to the inner wall of your uterus. The blastocysts grow and develop due to nutrition from the vesicular system. The fetus forms inside this cellular mass. The mother’s body continues to generate progesterone actively. This guarantees the growth and development of cells on the inner wall of the uterus and helps preserve the pregnancy. Each cell grows and becomes thicker.The embryo has the length of around 2 mm. It is so tiny, but if you look at it in the microscope, you’ll see that it resembles… a tadpole! Your baby’s heart starts beating. His main organs have begun developing: the notochord appears to soon become the spine, the basis of the neural system and the brain start forming. The facial features become slightly visible, the basics of the eye retina form, and the child becomes sensitive to light. In this week it becomes quite clear where the child’s head is and where are its tummy and back. The cells actively move to the embryo’s brain. The neural groove of the child has wrapped into the neural tube, it becomes thicker and starts forming the brain.The neural system of the child starts working, and the area around the mouth becomes sensitive. Certain changes have occurred to the skin of the child – it became thicker. Now the child is protected by the yolk sack and amniotic fluids. He is secure in this water world, just like a fish, and this gives him the possibility to move.WOW!</string>

How do you feel?Most women already feel their happiness, and this impacts their condition and mood: “storm changes to still water”, and vice versa. Sleepiness, fatigue, sickness and increased sensitivity to odors – these are all indications of a complete change of your body. The first indications of pregnancy are a delay of menstruation, enlargement of breasts and pains in this area. Further on, the pregnancy symptoms become clearer: headaches, lack of appetite and excessive fuss and selectiveness in food.Your tummy does not grow yet, thus, there are no visible changes to your frame. However, your uterus is enlarged.Tests and examinationsIt is high time to get a pregnancy test from the pharmacy and finally find out about your new status.At the end of the fifth week you can go for an ultrasonography, the size of the fetus already makes it visible on the monitor.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>In the case you already are attacked by toxipathy, you should stop cooking food, and try to eat a little of healthy food even if you don’t have an appetite. As far as which food to eat – eat what you like and don’t think of a diet.Sex and airfare are allowed this week in the case you don’t have abdominal pains and bloody excretions. You should immediately visit your doctor in the case you have those symptoms.The brown excretions are likely to signal a threat of interruption of the pregnancy, so you might also have pains in the waist or abdomen.Greenish, white and yellow excretions are signs of an infection.</string>

		<string>In the fourth week of pregnancy your fetus may be called an embryo. During this week the following miracles happen: the differentiation of the tissue of the fetus, the active development of external fetus structures, the placenta, as well as the child’s velum. 
Now a new life germinates inside your body. The external blastocyte cells (the embryo at its early development stages) have securely rooted at the wall of your uterus. The yolk sack forms, which helps your body produce progesterone before the placenta ripens and takes this function. The first choripnic villi begin forming – and they are the premonitory symptoms of the placenta. Your body now clearly produces the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).
During this period begins the formation of the three main cell layers. By the end of this week the fetus looks like a small cylinder and it is possible to discern its cephalic pole. The outer layer of embryo cells is what gives start to the formation of skin, dental enamel and the formation of the buccal cavity, part of the intestine, the eye cornea, nails, hair and even the neural system.
And on the surface which will soon become the baby’s back, forms the neural plate which will later wrap into a tube. This means that a little more, and the fetus will start developing its spinal cord and brain.
The medium cell layer forms the muscles, bones and connecting tissue, while the inner one – the internal organs of the baby. Astonishing, isn’t it?
Be aware, that by the end of the fourth week your baby is minuscular (just 1 mm) and transparent, but you already may distinguish his face and the eye rudiments. The rudiments of internal organs also start forming: the lungs, the intestine, the liver, the gullet and even the pancreas and thyroid glands. The vesicular system already appeared and the heart started forming. Now you know what happens to your little one during this period of pregnancy.</string>

		<string>Your tummy did not enlarge and looks like before. You should not expect any serious changes to your frame before the sixteenth week. 
The symptoms of pregnancy may manifest themselves but you might easily take them for PMS: irritation, nervousness, sleepiness, fatigue and also enlargement of the breasts and increased sensitivity of the nipples. For example, some women may experience minor bleeding. This is normal. The amount of blood excretions will be much lower than during menstruation. 
Tests and medical examinations
Unfortunately the pregnancy test during this period may still show no result, however, in the case you can’t wait any longer you might opt for diagnosing pregnancy through a HCG test, as its concentration in your blood is already high enough.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>Extrauterine gestation won’t manifest itself during this period, however, a dead fetus may provoke bleeding which you may mistake for menstruation. There might be pains in the back or in the lower back, as well as white, brown or bloody excretions. They are not always connected to pregnancy. 
The miscarriage may go unnoticed for the woman. It might be caused by a simple cold, especially with high fever. You should exclude all alcohol, as a glass of wine or a mug of beer may lead to bad consequences. Try to avoid any unhealthy habits for the sake of the health of your future child. We also recommend you start taking multivitamin supplements or folic acid as soon as possible. However, you should consult your gynecologist first. Take care of yourself!</string>

		<string>In case you are in your third obstetrical week of the pregnancy your child is just a group of cells, you may read more on its development at the beginning of the article, but on the third week of conception it already began forming into a little human being.
The weight of the fetus by the third week amounts to 1 gram, and the length – to 16 mm.
This is the time of formation of the organs of the fetus, and in case some failure occurs, the flaws of development may become considerable, if not lethal. The form of the child is similar to a scythe, although you already may see his back, tummy, head, arms and legs. The future face preserves embryonic fissures, but you may guess where the eyes will be, there are formations of the ears and nose in the form of lines.
The neural plate deepened, formed a notch and finally wrapped into a tube, now the neural cells migrate through it to the head part of the embryo and form a node – the future brain. The embryo’s skin has become somewhat thicker: it now consists of two layers. A sensitive zone formed in the area of the mouth, the neural system starts working. Chondral formations of the skeleton bones appear, and the heart develops quickly – by the end of the week it has to start beating never to stop again throughout the child’s life. First shy and irregular, the beats become regular and rhythmic in three days.
The liver, the breathing tract, the thyroid gland and the pancreas start forming, as well as muscular tissue. Around the future spine – the chord, the mesomeres start forming from the mesenchymal leaf, which will later become muscles.</string>

		<string>The little one still can’t move, the first moves are a week ahead. The child during the third week of pregnancy lives in a minuscular water bag filled with amniotic fluid and receives nutrition not from his mother, but from the yolk sack, and his blood generations also happens there. The intestine of the fetus, which at first looked like a straight tube going along the body become longer and by the end of the third week after conception formed the first three turns. The intestine in the umbilical area is connected with the yolk sack. The amniotic sack filled with amniotic fluid will become the water world of the child from this week to birth, protecting it from any external influence and giving freedom of movement.</string>

		<string>On the third week of pregnancy the feelings of the woman are similar to those in the second half of the menstrual cycle.

Some women experience the enlargement of breasts which is connected to the prevailing of progesterone in their hormonal balance. Progesterone causes the accumulation of fluids in the body, thus, the woman sometimes complains of abdominal pains and has a feeling of fullness of her mammal glands.

The mood of the woman starts changing. This is especially true for those women, who are prone to PMS, with an unstable neural system which does not work as a clock.</string>

		<string>In the third week of pregnancy by the obstetric calendar it is impossible to diagnose the fact of pregnancy through ultrasonic tests, however, three weeks after the conception ultrasonic examination is very informative.
In case you are in the third week of pregnancy the size of the baby gives the possibility to see it, and by the end of the week you can see his heart beating. During this term there is a widely spread fault of ultrasonic examination when the heartbeat is not registered. Then the question arises whether the pregnancy had failed, and a new ultrasonic examination is scheduled in a week.
During the third week of the pregnancy the fetal egg does not occupy the full uterus cavity, it is too small and the embryo is no more than a light-colored spot. It does not move and the only sign of life is given by the heart. So why schedule an ultrasonography?
In the 2-3-4th weeks ultrasonography is usually scheduled to diagnose pregnancy and in case there are suspicions of pregnancy failure. It can’t provide any additional information. 
Laboratory norms
In the 3rd week the changes in blood tests are very clear and the hormonal balance changes very quickly. The most important hormones are progesterone, which preserves pregnancy, and Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). We already mentioned the norms of HCG in this article, in case you are in the 3rd week of pregnancy HCG reaches the level from 20000 to 200000, the norms of progesterone vary from lab to lab (as they use different calculation units). In general, progesterone in the 3rd week of pregnancy should not be too low, this may be a sign of interrupted pregnancy, and it also should not be too high. With healthy women there usually is no need to control progesterone levels.</string>

		<string>So far this is a dream rather than a real life existing in your tummy. Wait for another two weeks, and then one of the 300 thousand oocytes will meet the sperm and merge together, creating a small embryo, a little life which you will need to preserve over nine months.</string>
		<key>didYouKnowText</key>
		<string>The first week of pregnancy by obstetrical terms begins from the first day of the last period. They will give you this date when they do the ultrasonic examination.
Why is this so?
The thing is that the female organism is able to conceive in the middle of the menstrual cycle, around the 12-14th day after the beginning of the last menstruation. With the beginning of menstruation your body begins preparing its reproductive system and mobilizes its reserves. You just need to give it a hand!</string>

		<string>The feelings during the first week of gestation are just a mystery for any woman. She does not suspect pregnancy herself. But you can’t fool your body, which feels that a new life is about to be conceived, and starts making preparations for this happy event.
Since so far there is no baby as such, there also is no evidence such as morning sickness, intolerance to odors of food and perfume which you liked before. In general, the first two weeks of gestation flow secretly and remain unnoticed by the future mother.
However, the first week is decisive for the baby. It will determine the further development of the fetus and whether it will be able to lodge securely in the uterus.
The pregnancy test won’t make you happy in this case. And the pallid and barely noticeable second stripe of happiness will appear no earlier than in ten or twelve days.</string>

		<string>In case you are sure that your time has come and you are ready to enjoy motherhood, then change your life now and accept a new one. Very soon another little human will bring you joy. 
Tests:
With regard to medical tests we recommend that you go through a medical examination beforehand, two or three months before beginning your pregnancy planning. The earlier - the better. This time will suffice to resolve any health issues that you or your partner might have.
As far as for the tests which you need to take during diagnostics and control of pregnancy, during the first week the normal results should be as follows:
•	human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) no more than 5 mIU/L, 
•	progesterone no higher than 12-18 nM/l.
Ultrasonic examination
During the first week of the gestation calendar there is no need for ultrasonic examination since there is no actual baby, thus, you should leave this procedure for later. The only thing the good doctor will be able to see is the enlarged uterus cavity with liquid and clots. You are having your period.
Pay attention to balanced and substantive nutrition during pregnancy.
You want your baby to develop well and grow healthy and strong? Then don’t leave for tomorrow what you can do today. Namely, change your diet right now. Give preference to healthy and varied food: vegetables, fruit, cereals, vitamins – these are your best friends for now. Reduce consumption of strong tea and coffee, don’t drink beverages with gas. You also need to eat much less chocolate, this is hard for a candy girl, but to receive this gift of fate you need to sacrifice something. Pay attention that all these products may pose a real threat for the fetus. Smoking and alcohol are taboo!
Exclude all irritating factors from your life, organize your work and leisure in a way to reduce fatigue and tune yourself to positive emotions. Avoid stress; spend as much time as possible in open air. Be active – yoga, swimming and lots of sex – that’s your routine for the next couple of weeks!
In the case you haven’t studied the specifics of your period yet – it is high time to start. In the case you know how your body works you will be able to calculate when ovulation happens within the accuracy of a day. During this period the chance to get pregnant is very high, so don’t waste your time.</string>

		<string>As far as ovulation occurs at the end of the 12-14th day of the cycle, the two-week pregnancy term does not really count, as on the second week of pregnancy the fetus does not exist. However, this week may select the “leader” among the oocytes. In a couple of days the Graafian follicle containing your oocyte expands to the point of rupturing. Thus, the oocyte penetrates the abdominal cavity and on the 3-4th week the embryo attaches to you uterus. Rest assured that it will let you know about it. You may rush to ultrasonic examination right away to see your little one. Meanwhile your body is getting ready for the upcoming changes. This is just another step on the way to your new status – that of a prospective mother.</string>
		<key>didYouKnowText</key>
		<string>It is a good idea to make a two or three-day break in your sexual life. This is not a compulsory condition, but in certain cases it might help your partner accumulate active sperm. 
In case you have a 28-day menstrual cycle the ovulation will likely occur between the 12th and 16th days. These days are the most favorable for conception.
In order for at least one sperm cell to get to the “right spot” the gynecologists advice having sex in the missionary position or doggy-style (when the man is behind the woman).
After copulation you should lied down for at least 20-30 minutes and put a cushion under your pelvis.
This increases your chances of becoming a mother. Good luck!</string>

		<string>Either unfortunately or fortunately, the long-awaited symptoms of pregnancy are not evident yet, as in fact the pregnancy hasn’t yet occurred. However, by the end of this week you might see transparent excretions and experience increased sexual drive. This is a clear signal of the readiness of your body to conceive. One more thing: if you are getting sick you should know that this is not toxipathy. Perhaps you just ate something bad?
Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) still remains at a level of no more than 5 mIU/L. You should forget about tests and ultrasonic examination during this week. Don’t run ahead of the train. This is the time of active ovulation. Wait for the third week to come.</string>
		<key>payAttentionText</key>
		<string>Taking folic acid is very important as it helps prevent deviations in the development of the fetus, and plays a part in the formation of the brain, the central neural system and the vesicular system of the future child. It also helps the mother to bear the child as it hardens the bones and the spine, which will be heavily burdened during pregnancy.
It is a good idea to visit a geneticist as an analysis of the heredity will help prepare a forecast for the fetus and avoid potential problems and pathologies.
The prospective father also should pay attention to his health, especially to his diet. To increase male fertility three months before the planned conception the man should go on a diet reach in antioxidants, zinc, selenium (contained in tuna, Brazilian nuts and wholegrain products). It is also important to consume fatty acids (contained in fat fish species) and manganese (high concentration in leafy vegetables, eggs and wholegrain products).</string>
